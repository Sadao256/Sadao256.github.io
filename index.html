                <strong>A little about myself</strong><br>
                I am a passionate Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, working towards my bachelor's degree. <br>
                thanks to my education i have gotten the chance  to explore different programming languages and technologies, <br>
                including C++, Python, and JavaScript, and applying them to solve various problems. Outside of coding, I enjoy<br>
                hiking, playing video games, and reading webcomics on the internet. These hobbies not only allow me to unwind <br>
                but also inspire me to think creatively in both personal and professional pursuits.
